CssDiff 0.1.0.1

Parses CSS files and displays classes that have been removed

How to build:
1. run build.bat
2. executable will be in 'dist'


I wrote this utility because our team provides CSS to several other teams and we need to communicate to them when a CSS class they depend on has been removed

  -?, --help, -h             show help
  -f, --from=VALUE           required: the first css file name
  -t, --to=VALUE             required: the second css file name
  -v, --verbose[=VALUE]      quiet (only output removed class names), loud (output parse errors)

backlog:
- show added classes
- show selectors with changed definitions and diffs
